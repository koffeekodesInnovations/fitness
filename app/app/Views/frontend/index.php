            When you enrol for slimming services with SF2, you not only embark on a journey to good health and a fit body, but are also put on the path to complete wellness. With a thorough wellness analysis being part of all our slimming programs, many of our clients discovered the fact that their weight gain was either a result of, or accompanied by uncontrolled medical conditions such as Hypertension, Hypothyroid, PCOS, Diabetes, Hyperinsulinemia, Arthritis, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only 35 % people are aware of their underlying medical condition. This also includes, the presence of high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, or high sugar levels, which are all warning signs of obesity-associated disorders. Our clients who experience slow weight loss or exhibit symptoms of associated medical conditions are generally asked to get relevant medical tests done if they have not got it done in the past. This practice has helped many realize and discover their hidden medical conditions such as hypertension, hypothyroid, PCOS, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, anemia, hyperprolactinemia, gall stones and at times even multiple problems, which need immediate medical attention. The wellness program is then customized according to their medical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those clients, who are aware of their Medical condition, Medical test reports till last 3 months only are considered valid or else the client is asked to get the test repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the program, our highly qualified professionals also consult and interact with the family physician of the clients. This not only helps in coordinating wellness procedures with other treatments, but also helps effectively manage the existing condition. Due to our continued efforts, holistic approach and diagnosis, early intervention has been possible in a number of cases and medical conditions have been successfully managed at an initial level itself. From our immense treasure of information, we share below a few case studies of our esteemed clients. All of these exceptional individuals suffered from different health concerns. We catalogue their stories herein for the benefit of our readers, with the hope that they shall be a guiding and motivating force for you to understand and chalk out a plan for yourself on the journey towards Wellness.
